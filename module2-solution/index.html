                    The oldest and the de facto leader of the Bears, Grizzly is a fun-loving bear who tends to get the others into wacky and uncharacteristic situations. 
                    Grizzly is paradoxically highly sociable yet socially inept. 
                    Despite this, he is constantly wanting to meet new people and tries to befriend everyone he comes across.

                    He is the middle brother and is nicknamed Pan-Pan by Grizzly.
                    He is tender-hearted and easily becomes anxious or embarrassed.
                    It is revealed that Panda once lived in a controlled panda enclosure near a fictionalized version of Shanghai, China.

                <section> 
                    He is the youngest of the Bears. Ice Bear is often rather stoic and rarely speaks. 
                    When he does, he speaks mostly in the third person and says his name first instead of "I". 
                    It is revealed that Ice Bear was raised by a Russian man named Yuri after his mother was suggested to have been killed by poachers.
